# [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)

Conway chose his rules carefully, after considerable experimentation, to meet these criteria:

 1. There should be no explosive growth.
 2. There should exist small initial patterns with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes.
 3. There should be potential for [von Neumann universal constructors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_universal_constructor).
 4. The rules should be as simple as possible, whilst adhering to the above constraints.
